A java Tile Map 2D Game Engine draft written with Processing 3.4 (https://processing.org/). 

Started with the idea to solve the problem of how to render an isometric tilemap. Everything started with a pen and a sketch paper, drawing lines and trying to figure out the right
algorithm to sort the tiles in such an order that the map is seen as a 3d image.

The script is working smoothly however, everything is only the begining.
My goal is to build a game based on a society, simulated by the parameters of skills, relations, needs and reputations, a living society..
